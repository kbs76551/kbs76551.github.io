			<p>My journey with the Guide Dog Foundation for the blind started when I first came to UGA and 
			saw tons of guide dogs walking around</p></div>
			<p>with their student handlers. I went up to the first girl I
			saw, and I asked her how I could do something so awesome and meaningful.</p>
			<p>She set me up with all the details and I was hooked.</p>
			<div class="b">
			<p>It started with meetings upon meetings and obedience training classes, which I thoroughly enjoyed.</p></div>
			<p>I got to work with many other raisers' dogs and my excitement grew. Then
			classes were over for the spring semester and I was sad that</p>
			<p>I didn't have my own pup to train yet; 
			boy was it worth the wait!</p>

				<p>I went to the pickup location and got to meet the dog I would be spending the next year and a half with. It was so exciting!</p>
				<p>I mean just look at how cute she was when I picked her up!

			<p>Madison still has so much to learn and we have about a year or so of training together left.<p>
			<p>If being a guide dog ends up not being Madison's calling, there are so many other things she will be able to train for!<p>
			<p><b>Madison could be a</b><p>
				<ol>
					<li>Part of the breeding colony for the Foundation</li>
					<li> Guide dog</li>
					<li> Vet dog</li>
					<li>Other kind of assistance dog</li>
					<li>Detection dog</li>
				</ol>
			<p> And if none of these end up being the life for Madison, she will be up for adoption<p>
			<p> and you bet I will be first in line to get back the dog I raised with all my blood, sweat, and tears.</p>
